### Future Goals

While I'm currently focused on documentation, I'm eager to further develop my skills and become proficient in fixing existing bugs and introducing new features. I believe this will allow me to make more meaningful contributions to open-source projects and have a positive impact on the developer community.

I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to collaborating with other developers and expanding my knowledge in the open-source world.
