## Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about open-source software and have recently started contributing to various projects. My main focus has been on updating and improving documentation to make it more user-friendly and comprehensive.

### Current Contributions

- [keras-core](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core/pull/514): Added docstrings to functions
- [keras-core](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core/pull/513): Updated the comments based on the code
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/53980): Updated the documentation to replace the deprecated version of qgrid with Modin-spreadsheet
- [Huggingface/Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24307): Updated the README documentation to include a comprehensive list of tested versions for different dependencies, ensuring better compatibility and reliability.

### Future Goals

While I'm currently focused on documentation, I'm eager to further develop my skills and become proficient in fixing existing bugs and introducing new features. I believe this will allow me to make more meaningful contributions to open-source projects and have a positive impact on the developer community.

I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to collaborating with other developers and expanding my knowledge in the open-source world.
